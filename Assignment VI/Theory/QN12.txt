12. How is malloc() function different from calloc()  function?
Answer:
This Malloc() is different from Calloc() by following ways;

Malloc:
-The name malloc stands for memory allocation.
void *malloc(size_t n) returns a pointer to n bytes of uninitialized storage, or NULL if the request cannot be
satisfied. If the space assigned by malloc() is overrun, the results are undefined.

-Malloc() takes one argument that is, number of bytes.

-syntax of malloc():

-void *malloc(size_t n);
 
-Allocates n bytes of memory. If the allocation succeeds, a void pointer to the allocated memory is returned.
 Otherwise NULL is returned.

-Malloc is faster than calloc.



Calloc:
The name calloc stands for contiguous allocation.
void *calloc(size_t n, size_t size)returns a pointer to enough free space for an array of n objects of the specified
size, or NULL if the request cannot be satisfied. The storage is initialized to zero.

-calloc() take two arguments those are: number of blocks and size of each block.

-syntax of calloc():

-void *calloc(size_t n, size_t size);
 
-Allocates a contiguous block of memory large enough to hold n elements of sizebytes each. The allocated region is
 initialized to zero.

-Calloc takes little longer than mallocbecause of the extra step of initializing the allocated memory by zero. However,n
 in practice the difference in speed is very tiny and not recognizable.

1.	What is a pointer and explain its application.
Definition
A pointer is a variable which contains the address in memory of another variable. We can have a pointer to any variable type.
Pointer Applications in C Programming
Pointer is used for different purposes. Pointer is low level construct in programming which is used to perform high level task. Some of the pointer applications are listed below
•	Pointer are more efficient data array. They are used to manipulate arrays more easily by         moving pointers to them instead of moving the arrays themselves.
•	Passing Parameter by Reference.
•	Dynamic Memory Allocation or (DMA).
•	Passing String to a function.
•	Reducing size of parameter.
•	Pointer are used to create complex data structures such as link list, trees etc.
•	Pointer increases the execution speeds.
•	Pointer are used to communicate information about memory which returns the location of free memory. E.g. Using like malloc(), calloc(),realloc(),free().

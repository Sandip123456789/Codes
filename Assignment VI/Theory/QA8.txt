8.	Explain the pointer arithmetic with example.
Answer
A pointer in c is an address, which is a numeric value. Therefore, you can perform arithmetic operations on a pointer
just as you can on a numeric value. There are four arithmetic operators that can be used on pointers: ++, --, +, and -
To understand pointer arithmetic, let us consider that ptr is an integer pointer which points to the address 1000.
Assuming 32-bit integers, let us perform the following arithmetic operation on the pointer -
    ptr++
After the above operation, the ptr will point to the location 1004 because each time ptr is incremented,
it will point to the next integer location which is 4 bytes next to the current location. This operation will move the pointer
to the next memory location without impacting the actual value at the memory location. If ptr points to a character whose
address is 1000, then the above operation will point to the location 1001 because the next character will be available at 1001.
